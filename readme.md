# Polygon Framework by Elton Mesquita

> A flexible (mini)framework built with small and medium projects in mind. It doesn't provide style, but just the bare minimal boilerplate to build modern and well coded pages.

It also proposes a basic structure for your projects, follow it or not, it's up to you (as it should be).
