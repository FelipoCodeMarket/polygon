# Polygon Framework by Elton Mesquita

> A flexible SASS based (mini)framework built with small and medium projects in mind. It doesn't provide style, but just the bare minimal boilerplate to build modern and well coded pages.

It also proposes a basic structure for your projects, follow it or not, it's up to you (as it should be).

## Yet another Framework? Why?
Yep! There are a lot of Framework these days and everyday pop a new one (including this very own). But there are some problems with most os these framework:
- They force down a coding method that not always suits your needs;
- They are usually aimed at big projects. Even if you use just some modules you still end up with a lot unused code;
- They are usually big and have a lot of lines of code and an extensive documentation and takes a lot of time to master;
- You usually have to (re)write all your markup to fit the Framework's guideline;

In the latest years I have used some Frameworks to build my pages. But everytime I used a Framework I ended up using it less extensively, because I just did not need everything it had to offer. I used the most famous and the not so famous Frameworks, but still every single one had the same issues I have mentioned above. 

One (micro)Framework has caught my attention, [Toast](https://daneden.me/toast/) by [Daniel Eden](https://daneden.me/). It is just 150 lines of CSS and has just the bare minimum that you will use in any page. It is so simple that you can master it in about 5 or 10 minutes. The idea behind Polygon looks like the Toast Framework, but extends it a little bit. As for the today web there are some more components that are largely used and are not provided by Toast.

The aim of the Polygon Framework is to sit right between a micro-framework like Toast and a full featured framework like [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [ZURB's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). It tries to be so flexible as possible and does not force who uses it to follow a strict method or way to code but instead, it proposes a basic structure for your project and a more efficient, semantic and flexible way to write your markup, mainly for tiny, small and medium projects.
